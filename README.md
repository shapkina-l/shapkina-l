# Hi there! üëã I'm Liudmila Shapkina

## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me
I'm a software developer with a focus on **backend development**, currently studying at [42 Berlin](https://www.42berlin.de/). With a solid background in **C**, **C++**, and **Python**, I am passionate about building efficient, scalable systems. I also have experience in **server management** on **Ubuntu** and working with the **Django** library for backend solutions.

Previously, I worked as an architect and lead urban planner, specializing in spatial design, urban systems, and GIS-based analysis. My experience managing complex projects and integrating data-driven decision-making sparked my interest in technology. After running my own business, I transitioned into software development, combining my design thinking, analytical skills, and technical expertise to build efficient, scalable digital solutions.

## üî• Featured Projects

## üßë‚Äçüéì Learning projects

### [Custom Shell: C](https://github.com/shapkina-l/minishell)
A fully functional shell built from scratch, supporting **basic commands**, **piping**, and **error handling**. This project improved my understanding of **process management**, **memory allocation**, and **system calls** in Linux.

//### [Non-blocking Web Server: C++](https://github.com/ddavlet/webserv)
//A high-performance web server built using C/C++, handling multiple client requests. This project was //essential in understanding **non-blocking polling**, **HTTP standards**, and **socket programming**.

//### [Microservices deployment: Docker](https://github.com/ddavlet/inception)
//System administation by using Docker. Building several Dockers with Docker compose, networking and shared //volumes.

//### [Philosophers problem: C](https://github.com/ddavlet/Philosophers)
//Solving a philosophers problem with **multi-threading** and **multi-processing**. This project provides //insights to data races problem, thread synchronization and inter-process communication using semaphores.

### [Building pseudo 3D game: C](https://github.com/shapkina-l/cub3d)
Cub3D is a raycasting-based 3D graphical project inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D game. Developed using **C** and the **miniLibX** library, the project simulates a first-person view inside a maze, where the player navigates and interacts with the environment. The project emphasizes core computer science concepts such as memory management, event handling, and graphical rendering while exploring the use of mathematics in game development.

//### [Pong cross-platform game: Multilanguage](https://github.com/ddavlet/ft_transcendence)
//This project involves building a web application using Django, focusing on user management, security, and //gameplay experience. The application allows users to play a real-time multiplayer Pong game, with key //features such as two-factor authentication (2FA), JWT-based authentication, and user registration with //customizable profiles. Additionally, the project implements an API server, security measures (password //hashing, protection against XSS/SQL injections), and a CLI-based Pong client.

//## üóÇ Projects

//### [Telegram sms gateway: Python](https://github.com/ddavlet/telegram_sms_gateway)
//This project, Telegram SMS Gateway, is a system that allows sending SMS via Telegram by integrating a //Telegram bot with an SMS gateway. It is designed to automate sending SMS messages directly from Telegram, //simplifying the communication process.

//### [Telegram Wohnung Finder](https://github.com/ddavlet/wg_gesucht_easyfinder)
//Find your new home fast and easy!

## üå± Currently Learning
I‚Äôm currently deepening my knowledge in:
- **Advanced backend architectures** with a focus on scalable solutions.
