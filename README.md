# Hi there! 👋 I'm Liudmila Shapkina

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I'm a software developer with a focus on **backend development**, currently studying at [42 Berlin](https://www.42berlin.de/). With a solid background in **C**, **C++**, and **Python**, I am passionate about building efficient, scalable systems. I also have experience in **server management** on **Ubuntu** and working with the **Django** library for backend solutions.

Previously, I worked as an architect and lead urban planner, specializing in spatial design, urban systems, and GIS-based analysis. My experience managing complex projects and integrating data-driven decision-making sparked my interest in technology. After running my own business, I transitioned into software development, combining my design thinking, analytical skills, and technical expertise to build efficient, scalable digital solutions.

## 🧑‍🎓 Learning projects

### [Custom Shell: C](https://github.com/shapkina-l/minishell)
A fully functional shell built from scratch, supporting **basic commands**, **piping**, and **error handling**. This project improved my understanding of **process management**, **memory allocation**, and **system calls** in Linux.

### [Building pseudo 3D game: C](https://github.com/shapkina-l/cub3d)
Cub3D is a raycasting-based 3D graphical project inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D game. Developed using **C** and the **miniLibX** library, the project simulates a first-person view inside a maze, where the player navigates and interacts with the environment. The project emphasizes core computer science concepts such as memory management, event handling, and graphical rendering while exploring the use of mathematics in game development.
